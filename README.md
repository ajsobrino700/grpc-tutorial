# GRPC (Google remote procedure call) tutorial

This repository has some information about **gRPC**. [@ajsobrino700](https://github.com/ajsobrino700) has done some notes about the functionality of **gRPC** and **protobuf**.

It is a simple repository where there is documentation about the protocol and some examples.

It is a personal project that we used to learn and practise about this technology.
